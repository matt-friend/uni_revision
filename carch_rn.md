# Introduction to Computer Architecture - Revision notes

## Week 1 - Boolean Algebra
* Boolean Algebra is central to computer architecture; underpins logic

### Propositional Logic
* A **proposition** is basically a statement e.g.
	* the temperature is 20<sup>o</sup>C
	* the temperature is x<sup>o</sup>C
* A proposition must be: 
	* unambiguous - e.g. not something like "the temperature is too hot"
	* Evaluate to a true or false value - e.g. not "this statement is false"
* A proposition *can* include free variables (predicate) and *can* be represented using a short-hand variable or function. In this case, free variables must be bound to arguments before evaluation
* Single statements can be combined with **connectives** like:
	* Not,			|Â¬		Negation
	* And,			|&and		Conjunction
	* Or, 			|&or		(inclusive) Disjunction
	* Xor, 			|&otimes	(exclusive) Disjunction
	* Implies, 		|&rArr		Implication
	* Is equivalent to, 	|&equiv		Equivalence
* Use a truth table to evaluate possible outcomes of a compound proposition

* Axioms are the rules of Boolean algebra
* There are many axioms denoting how expressinsare equivalent e.g.
	* Identity
	* Absorption
	* Distribution

* Use axioms to simplify expressions intelligently
	* acknowledge repeating expressions
* many different ways to compare boolean functions
	* simplification/ mutation via axioms
	* brute force enumeration (truth table)

* Other conjunctions are universal/ functionally complete
	* NAND = not and = <span>&#8892</span>
	* NOR = not or = &barvee
