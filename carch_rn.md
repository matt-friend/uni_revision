# Introduction to Computer Architecture - Revision notes

## Week 1 - Boolean Algebra
* Boolean Algebra is central to computer architecture; underpins logic

### Propositional Logic
* A **proposition** is basically a statement e.g.
	* the temperature is 20<sup>o</sup>C
	* the temperature is x<sup>o</sup>C
* A proposition must be: 
	* unambiguous - e.g. not something like "the temperature is too hot"
	* Evaluate to a true or false value - e.g. not "this statement is false"
* A proposition *can* include free variables (predicate) and *can* be represented using a short-hand variable or function. In this case, free variables must be bound to arguments before evaluation
* Single statements can be combined with **connectives** like:
	* Not,			Â¬	Negation
	* And,			&#8743	Conjunction
	* Or, 			&#8744	(inclusive) Disjunction
	* Xor, 			&#8855	(exclusive) Disjunction
	* Implies, 		&#8658	Implication
	* Is equivalent to, 	&#8660	Equivalence
* Use a truth table to evaluate possible outcomes of a compound proposition
