#### Goals toward Object Orientation
* Modularity - code is well organised in small unites, easy to handle
* Reusability - able to avoid coding same behaviour over and over
* Maintainablity - easily add features/ override outdated behaviour
* Low coupling, high cohesion - parts are compact but independent; shared workload between groups
* Scalability - small programs can be combined into complex programs without loss of control

#### Roles of class
Class is a type for variables and objects
* structure with fields
* is a closure (has context variables for its methods)
* is a module, separately combilable
* is a namespace, avoiding clashes
* is a component, providing a design tool
* is a unit, supporting automated testing

#### Concept of an object
Objects combine data and methods that manipulate that data
* objects both are and do something (stateful and active)
* unique identity
* responsible for own data
* communicate with other objects by method calls
* expose information to other objects

#### Concept of a class
* objects belong to and are instances of a class
* classes act like a module or unit of description
* act like a struct in C (set out features)
* act like a context or name space providing implicit locality (dot notation)
* building blocks for small, reliable, compact program components
* these can be reused, refined, but mainly combined to form complex programs

#### Instantiation
* Constructor is method for object instantiation
* e.g. Robot c3p0 = new Robot("C3P0")
